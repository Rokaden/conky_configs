This is the revision to my earlier conky. Now it is a lua only conky, with both the images and text being drawn by the lua script.

The script uses 3 stamp images.
stamp1: when height > width
stamp2: when width > height
stamp3: when width = height
The reason I used 3 different images was because while scaling a single image, the stamp outline was distorted too much for my liking.
You can specify the image file to be used by file=<image> in the settings table.
The script will use a default image if you fail to provide the image name. (get_stampimage())

The stamp images are filled with 75% white so it gives a slight transparency.

Images used:

Suggestions are welcome. You can post them on the Crunchbang Monster conky thread or pm me.

Thanks.
